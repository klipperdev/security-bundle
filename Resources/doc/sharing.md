Using the sharing
=================

Given that you cannot set permissions directly on entity, you must use the SharingManager
(`klipper_security.sharing_manager`).

**Important:**

To use the sharing, you must add the dependency `klipper/doctrine-extensions`:

```
$ composer require klipper/doctrine-extensions
```

## Installation

### Step 1: Create the sharing model

Run this command to create the Sharing entity:

```
$ php bin/console make:entity

 Class name of the entity to create or update (e.g. BraveGnome):
 > Sharing

 created: src/Entity/Sharing.php
 created: src/Repository/SharingRepository.php

 Entity generated! Now let's add some fields!
 You can always add more fields later manually or by re-running this command.

 New property name (press <return> to stop adding fields):
 >
```

To make your Sharing entity compatible with this bundle, you must update the entity by implementing the interface
`Klipper\Component\Security\Model\SharingInterface`, the trait `Klipper\Component\Security\Model\Traits\SharingTrait` and
the Doctrine indexes/constraints like:

```php
use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use Klipper\Component\Security\Model\SharingInterface;
use Klipper\Component\Security\Model\Traits\SharingTrait;

/**
 * ...
 *
 * @ORM\Table(
 *     indexes={
 *         @ORM\Index(name="idx_sharing_subject_class", columns={"subject_class"}),
 *         @ORM\Index(name="idx_sharing_subject_id", columns={"subject_id"}),
 *         @ORM\Index(name="idx_sharing_identity_class", columns={"identity_class"}),
 *         @ORM\Index(name="idx_sharing_identity_name", columns={"identity_name"})
 *     },
 *     uniqueConstraints={
 *         @ORM\UniqueConstraint(name="uniq_sharing", columns={"subject_class", "subject_id", "identity_class", "identity_name"})
 *     }
 * )
 */
class Sharing implements SharingInterface
{
    use SharingTrait;

    // ...
}
```

### Step 2: Enable the sharing for a class

There is a difference between permission and sharing. The permissions tell you whether
the user, role, or group have access rights based on operations (view, create, etc...),
and if the Object Filter is enabled, the entity is cleaned at loading, leaving only
the Id (always) and the authorized field values. However, permissions do not filter the
doctrine queries. To do this, you must enable and configure the sharing.

For entities to be filtered at the time of the Doctrine query, you have the option to
build your own `SQLFilter`, Or use the `SharingFilter` class in this bundle:

```yaml
# config/packages/doctrine.yaml
doctrine:
    orm:
        resolve_target_entities:
            Klipper\Component\Security\Model\SharingInterface: App\Entity\Sharing # the FQCN of your sharing entity

        entity_managers:
            default:
                filters:
                    klipper_sharing:
                        class:   Klipper\Component\Security\Doctrine\ORM\Filter\SharingFilter
                        enabled: true
```

This filter requires a small configuration to know what you want to do with it. By
default, the sharing for all classes is disabled (`none` value). But to filter all
records and showing only the shared records, you will use the `private` value for
all class that need a sharing, and for that, you will need to add this configuration:

```yaml
# config/packages/klipper_security.yaml
klipper_security:
    doctrine:
        orm:
            listeners:
                private_sharing: true # Enable the 'private' sharing filter type
                sharing_delete:  true # Enable the auto sharing delete when the entity is deleted
            filters:
                sharing:         true # Enable the Doctrine ORM SQL Filter for sharing the entities (optional)
    sharing:
        enabled:             true
        identity_types:
            App\Entity\User:
                roleable:    true
                permissible: true
            App\Entity\Role:
                permissible: true
            App\Entity\Group:
                permissible: true    # If you use the groups
            App\Entity\Organization:
                permissible: true    # If you use the organizations
        subjects:
            App\Entity\Post: private
```

Also, make sure to make and run a migration for the new entities:

```
$ php bin/console make:migration
$ php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

In this way you enable the `SQLFilter` to filter any entity that is not shared with either
a user, a role, a group, or an organization.

> **Note:**
>
> You will find the values and their descriptions in the class `Klipper\Component\Security\SharingVisibilities`.

### Step 3: Add the mapping between permission and sharing

To make your Permission entity compatible with the sharing, you must update the entity by implementing the interface
`Klipper\Component\Security\Model\Traits\PermissionSharingEntryInterface`, and the trait
`Klipper\Component\Security\Model\Traits\PermissionSharingEntryTrait` like:

```php
use Klipper\Component\Security\Model\Traits\PermissionSharingEntryInterface;
use Klipper\Component\Security\Model\Traits\PermissionSharingEntryTrait;

class Permission implements PermissionInterface, PermissionSharingEntryInterface
{
    use PermissionTrait;
    use PermissionSharingEntryTrait;

    // ...
}
```

## Create the sharing entry

You can share an entity with a user, a role, a group, or an organization.

To edit the sharing entry, you can use directly the object instance of permission like
any doctrine entity, that is you can use the Symfony Form, Symfony Validator, and Doctrine
to create, update or delete the sharing entry.

Whether you edit sharing entry directly with the model or with Symfony Form, you must defined
this required fields:

- subject class (the FQCN of entity)
- subject id (the id of entity)
- identity class (the FQCN of user, role, group or organization)
- identity name (the username, role name, group name or organization name)

The sharing model works with the Subject Identities for the entities (see
`Klipper\Component\Security\Identity\SubjectIdentity`) and Security Identity for the user, role,
group, and organization (see `Klipper\Component\Security\Identity\UserSecurityIdentity`,
`Klipper\Component\Security\Identity\RoleSecurityIdentity`,
`Klipper\Component\Security\Identity\GroupSecurityIdentity` and
`Klipper\Component\Security\Identity\OrganizationSecurityIdentity`).

To retrieve the subject infos, you have these helpers:

- `SubjectIdentity::fromObject($object)`
- `SubjectIdentity::fromClassname($className)`

To retrieve the identity infos, you have these helpers:

- `UserSecurityIdentity::fromAccount($user)`
- `UserSecurityIdentity::fromToken($token)`
- `RoleSecurityIdentity::fromAccount($role)`
- `RoleSecurityIdentity::fromToken($token)`
- `GroupSecurityIdentity::fromAccount($group)`
- `GroupSecurityIdentity::fromToken($token)`
- `OrganizationSecurityIdentity::fromAccount($organization)`
- `OrganizationSecurityIdentity::fromToken($organization, $context = null, $roleHierarchy = null)`

All helpers return the instance of `Klipper\Component\Security\Identity\SecurityIdentityInterface`,
and you retrieve the type and the identifier that will must be used for the sharing instance.

It's not necessary to have a specific manager to manage the sharing entry,
use directly the model of the sharing.

### Example

**Add sharing entry:**

```php
use App\Entity\Post;
use App\Entity\Sharing;
use App\Entity\User;
use Klipper\Component\Security\Identity\SubjectIdentity;
use Klipper\Component\Security\Identity\UserSecurityIdentity;

$user = $userRepository->findOneByUsername('foo.bar');
$userIdentity = UserSecurityIdentity::fromAccount($user);

$post = $postRepository->findOneBy(array('id' => 42));
$postIdentity = SubjectIdentity::fromObject($post);

$share = (new Sharing())
    ->setSubjectClass($postIdentity->getType())
    ->setSubjectId($postIdentity->getIdentifier())
    ->setIdentityClass($userIdentity->getType())
    ->setIdentityName($userIdentity->getIdentifier())
;

$em->persist($share);
$em->flush();
```

When you create a sharing entry, the identity of sharing (user, role, group or organization)
retrieves automatically the equivalent of the `view` permission of the class.

Of course, the user must have permissions on the class (and fields) to retrieve the shared entity,
and he has the authorizations via the permissions of all its roles, or the roles attached to the
sharing entry, or directly with the permissions attached to the sharing entry.

## Attach the permissions on a sharing entry

You can define permissions for each sharing entry:

```php
use App\Entity\Post;
use App\Entity\Sharing;
use App\Entity\User;
use Klipper\Component\Security\Identity\SubjectIdentity;
use Klipper\Component\Security\Identity\UserSecurityIdentity;

$user = $userRepository->findOneByUsername('foo.bar');
$userIdentity = UserSecurityIdentity::fromAccount($user);

$post = $postRepository->findOneBy(array('id' => 42));
$postIdentity = SubjectIdentity::fromObject($post);

$permissionSendEmails = $permissionRepository->findOneBy(array(
    'operation' => 'send-emails',
    'class' => null,
    'field' => null,
));
$share = $shareRepository->findOneBy(array(
    'subjectClass' => $postIdentity->getType(),
    'subjectId' => $postIdentity->getIdentifier(),
    'identityClass' => $userIdentity->getType(),
    'identityName' => $userIdentity->getIdentifier(),
));

$share->addPermission($permissionSendEmails);

$em->persist($share);
$em->flush();
```

You can also use directly the doctrine collection of permissions in sharing if you wish it.

```php
$share->getPermissions()->add($permissionSendEmails);
```

## Attach the roles on a sharing entry

You can define roles for each sharing entry (user only):

```php
use App\Entity\Post;
use App\Entity\Sharing;
use App\Entity\User;
use Klipper\Component\Security\Identity\RoleSecurityIdentity;
use Klipper\Component\Security\Identity\SubjectIdentity;
use Klipper\Component\Security\Identity\UserSecurityIdentity;

$user = $userRepository->findOneByUsername('foo.bar');
$userIdentity = UserSecurityIdentity::fromAccount($user);

$post = $postRepository->findOneBy(array('id' => 42));
$postIdentity = SubjectIdentity::fromObject($post);

$adminRole = $roleRepository->findOneByName('ROLE_ADMIN');

$share = $shareRepository->findOneBy(array(
    'subjectClass' => $postIdentity->getType(),
    'subjectId' => $postIdentity->getIdentifier(),
    'identityClass' => $userIdentity->getType(),
    'identityName' => $userIdentity->getIdentifier(),
));

$share->addRole($adminRole->getName());

$em->persist($share);
$em->flush();
```

You can also use directly the doctrine collection of roles in sharing if you wish it.

```php
$share->getRoles()->add($adminRole);
```

## Define an activation date

You can define the activation date to create a sharing entry but activate this sharing
only after a date.

## Define an expiration date

You can define the expiration date to create a sharing entry but disable this sharing
only after a date.

> **Note:**
>
> Even though the share entry is in the database, and the Doctrine filter selects only valid
> share entries, it is recommended that you create a CRON task to regularly delete the expired
> share entries.

## Why is there no manager to edit the sharing entry?

This library doesn't include a manager to manage sharing with entities, because it uses natively Doctrine,
and leaves you the choice to using Doctrine directly, to creating you a specific manager or to using a
resource management library (like [klipper/resource-bundle](https://github.com/klipperdev/resource-bundle)).
